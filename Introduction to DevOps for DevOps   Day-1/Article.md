# 🤖⚡AI-Assisted DevOps 10 Day Course 📊🚀

The landscape of AI is gaining traction in every sector due to its benefits of making our day-to-day activities  more efficient. AI has come to stay either we embrase it or you are left behind.In the world of DevOps,  AI is a game changer for DevOps. The 10 Day AI-assisted DevOps course organized by Abhishek is an amazing course for  every DevOps/Cloud Engineers.   

## Day-1 : Introduction to DevOps for DevOps
Key takeawys of Day 1 

### 🎯Why AI is the the game change for DevOps
AI has become the  game-changer for DevOps because it helps automates repetitive tasks  like code testing, deployments, and monitoring, AI can also help detect and fixes bugs and issues faster. Overall this speeds up CI/CD pipelines, reduces human error, and lets teams focus more  on innovation rather than repetitive tasks . 🚀
### 🤖 Traditional AI Vrs Generative AI 📊
1️⃣ Traditional AI uses historical data and predictive models to predict events. Tradional AI is good at  classification, forecasting, parttern recognition  and anomaly detection. In DevOps Tradtional AI used to predict events and partterns that can help in observability and incident management. 

2️⃣ Generative AI (Gen AI) leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze, summarize, and even generate new content dynamically. Gen AI is used Code Generation & Optimization, Automated Documentation & Knowledge Management etc. 

### 🧠 What are Large Language Models (LLMs)?
Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can understand, generate, and process human language.These models use deep learning techniques, particularly transformers (like GPT, BERT, or LLaMA), to recognize patterns, predict words, and generate human-like responses.

### ✍️ What is Prompt Engineering ?
Prompt Engineering is basically the technique of crafting prompts (inputs) for LLMs. A good prompt can help you generate the desired output and get the most out of a generative AI. More on Prompt engineering in Day 2.

### 🤖🛠️ AI landscape (AI Tools that that a DevOps Engineer should Know )
1️⃣ AI chatbots:LLaMA, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, 
2️⃣ AI Agents: Github co
3️⃣ AI Assistance:
4️⃣ Programming Language: Python (FasAPI Flask, Django)

### 🛠️ Hands-on/Project
Create a GitHub repository that contains a bash script. when executed the bash script confirms the health of a virtual machine by looking at the parameters such as cpu, disk space, memory e.t.c.,. Please note that the bash script should also support a command line argument named "explain", when passed, "explain" provides the detailed summary of the health status.
