# AI Assisted DevOps: Day 3, Prompt Enginering

## What is Prompt Engineering?
In a nutshell prompt engineering can be described as the technique of crafting natural language text to guide Generative AI to generate a desired output. Gen-AI tries to mimic humans, it still requires very detailed instructions to produce high-quality and desired outputs. Prompt Engineering is an essential skill that everyone should have whe it come to Generative AI. The  quality of your prompt (Input) to a Gen-AI determines your quality of your desired output. 

## Prompt Engineering workflow.

To craft a good prompt , above is the workflow one can use as a guide:
1. Define your Objective: You should clearly identify what you want to achieve.  
2. Gather Context: Collect some relevant information about your environment, requirements, and constraints that will help in crafting a good prompt. 
3. Draft Initial Prompt: Create your first version of the prompt
4. Execute Prompt: Submit/Execute your  prompt to the AI system
5. Evaluate Output: Assess whether the result meets your needs and can accomplish your objective.

## why Prompt Engineering important to DevOps Engineers?
Prompt enginerring can help DevOps engineers some 
- ‚úÖ. Generate optimized CI/CD scripts (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
- ‚úÖ. Automate Kubernetes, Terraform, and Ansible configurations.
- ‚úÖ. Assist in troubleshooting and debugging.
- ‚úÖ. Generate custom Bash, Python, or YAML scripts.
- ‚úÖ. Improve incident response and root cause analysis.

## Prompt Engineering Techniques

### 1 Zero-Shot Prompting:
Zero-shot prompting means that the prompt used to communicate with the model does  not include any examples or demos. With  zero-shot prompt, you  instruct  the model to perform  a task without any  examples to guide it.

Example: 

**Prompt:** Generate a Shell Script to Backup Logs

**Output**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Configuration
LOG_DIR="/var/log"  # Directory containing log files
BACKUP_DIR="/backup/logs"  # Backup storage location
MAX_BACKUPS=5  # Number of backups to retain
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S")
BACKUP_FILE="$BACKUP_DIR/logs_backup_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz"

# Create backup directory if it does not exist
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Create a compressed backup of the logs
tar -czf "$BACKUP_FILE" -C "$LOG_DIR" .

# Remove old backups, keeping only the most recent $MAX_BACKUPS backups
ls -t "$BACKUP_DIR"/logs_backup_*.tar.gz | tail -n +$((MAX_BACKUPS + 1)) | xargs rm -f

# Print completion message
echo "Backup completed: $BACKUP_FILE"
```

### 2 Few-Shot Prompting
In few-shot prompting, you provide the model with some  few examples, usually 2-3 examples  to help  guide the AI in its response.
Example:

**Prompt**:
Here are some shell scripts to manage logs:

Example 1:
# Create a log file
touch /var/logs/app.log
echo "Application started" > /var/logs/app.log

Example 2:
# Archive old logs
tar -czf /backup/app_logs.tar.gz /var/logs/*

Now write a script to delete logs older than 7 days.

**OutPut**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set the log directory
LOG_DIR="/var/logs"

# Find and delete log files older than 7 days
find $LOG_DIR -name "*.log" -type f -mtime +7 -exec rm {} \;

echo "Logs older than 7 days have been deleted."

# Optionally log this cleanup operation
echo "$(date): Log cleanup performed - files older than 7 days removed" >> $LOG_DIR/cleanup.log
```
### 3 Multi-Shot Prompting

### 4 Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enables complex reasoning capabilities through intermediate reasoning steps. Here, you ask the AI to detail its thought process step-by-step. This is particularly useful for complex reasoning tasks.

Example:

## Use Cases for DevOps Prompt Engineering
Here are some use cases that for AI in DevOps
- ‚úÖ 1. Generating IaC (Infrastructure as Code)
- ‚úÖ 2. CI/CD Pipeline Automation and Optimization
- ‚úÖ 3. Technical Documentation
- ‚úÖ 4. Generate custom Bash, Python, or YAML scripts
- ‚úÖ 5. Log Analysis & Incident Response


## Best Practices for Prompt Engineering
- 1Ô∏è‚É£. Be clear and specific ‚Äì The more specific the prompt, the better the output.
- 2Ô∏è‚É£. Use context ‚Äì Provide background information or examples when needed.
- 3Ô∏è‚É£. Define the Output Format- Always specify the format you need
- 4Ô∏è‚É£.Iterate and refine ‚Äì If the output isn‚Äôt ideal, adjust the prompt.
- 5Ô∏è‚É£.Use CoT for complex tasks ‚Äì Step-by-step reasoning improves accuracy. 


##  Conclusion
With AI evolving, prompt engineering will play a crucial role in improving helping DevOps engineers in their day-to-day activities. Mastering effective prompting will make you a 10x DevOps engineer! üöÄ
